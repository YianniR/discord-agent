"this is the bortle scale. it's used to measure how dark the night sky is in a given place. until relatively recently in human history i imagine every human being who ever lived could see a bortle 1 sky every night of their lives, weather permitting. i personally have never seen darker than bortle 4 in my entire life, and that only happened once. \n\nwhen i was in college i saw a video on youtube, it was a time-lapse of a barbecue in texas or something, and the sky was around bortle 2-3. i was extremely shocked that the milky way was clearly, brilliantly visible to the naked eye, which i had never seen in my entire life and hadn't actually understood was a thing that could happen. i thought you needed a telescope or something. this is despite my having both a big glossy book about astronomy and a big glossy book about mythology in my childhood bedroom, where i had both read about the milky way as a galaxy and as a part of human mythology dating back thousands of years. \n\nit's fucking big as hell in the sky. it was much bigger than i was expecting. it has names in other languages that make this more obvious. in asian languages it's called the ""river of heaven"" or the ""silver river."" in indian languages it's called the ""ganges river of the sky."" it's a big fucking river in the fucking sky and you're supposed to be able to see it with your fucking eyes. \n\nhere's a quote from a thread on an astronomy forum called cloudynights about what it's like to experience bortle 1, from Bob4BVM: \n\n> There are a few places where I go in certain mountain areas of far eastern Oregon to get to¬†¬†Bortle 1.\n\n> One is a site at over 9500 feet on a mountain surrounded by desert with the nearest town streetlights over 100 miles away.\n\n> I will never forget the first time we were camped there. The stars were so bright & clear that the experience was like you were standing IN the dome of the heavens, not below it, the 3-D feeling was unmistakable.¬† Yes the stars colors were very distinct, adding to the 3-D effect.\n\n> I did however find it initially disturbing that there was a huge band of smoky haze that ran from horizon to horizon roughly following the plane of the Milky Way. I was at first offended that smoke would be messing up the great view of our galaxy.\n\n> It took a while for it to sink in, but I finally realized... what looked like 'smoke' was the huge outer halo of the galaxy, extending far above and below the bright band of the galaxy, easily tripling¬† its overall width.¬† I did not have a telescope along on that first camping trip to that mountain.¬† None was necessary, it would have diluted the immersive experience of just laying on my back and taking in that enormous river of stars which to its outer limits covered fully half of the visible sky from horizon to horizon.\n\nwhen i look at the night sky (bortle 7-9) i like to imagine being alive 5000 years ago and getting to see bortle 1 every night. i like to imagine wondering what the hell is going on with all this stuff in the sky. what is it? why does it move around like that? what does it all mean? or if i don't ask myself these questions maybe i'm chilling with a kid and they ask me. and then maybe i start telling stories to entertain the kid. and i imagine people naming the planets and the stars and the constellations, and inventing gods and monsters and astronomy and astrology, and mathematics, and physics, and eventually - \n\nwell, y'know, the electric light."

"Truest shit I've ever read.\n\nIn 2017, out of nowhere, I developed severe food allergies. This is the intellectual topic I've thought/about researched most since then, talking, experimenting, binging Attia podcasts.\n\nFrom what I can tell ~all common dietary advice is true at the same time. From what I can tell the following categories all matter:\n- Calorie Amount (Textbook)\n- Carb Amount (Keto)\n- Protein Content (Lifters)\n- Digestibility/Fibre Count (Salad people)\n- Vitamins (Mom)\n- Hormones + their precursors (Peat)\n- Food Processing (Paleo)\n- Genetic Modification (Decels)\n- Oxidational Load (Seed Oil People)\n- Fructose intake (Low Sugar)\n- Acidity (Hay Diet)\n- Amount of chewing (Grandma)\n- Personal Genetics (IDK, the right wing maybe?)\n- Stress Level (Psychiatrists?)\n\nRealistically you can simplify this in a budgetary model, you have X budget to spend on violating these rules. Your allowance depends heavily on your genetics. \n\nMost of us are in a very distracted state where we do not even notice sub-optimality. This is why ANY change in diet away from the Standard American Diet (SAD, ""eat whatever, whenever"") improves outcomes in studies. Doesn't matter if it's potatoes only or veganism, any focus on what you're eating will make you eat less garbage.\n\nThe substances incentivise this by various mechanisms, sugar is sth like an ""antiseptic"", suppresses nausea and directly interacts with the dopamine system like many drugs. Similar for hot spices, though those work by masking other responses with pain. This manifests as cravings and the ability to ""just eat more"". Sugar literally just makes you more hungry (""there's always room for desert""). Ozempic breaks this pathway.\nhttps://t.co/wZNxzlVWXm\n\nHuman's capacity for mimetic desire + cognitive dissonance reduction means there are gigantic cope-fields around food, once you start trying to change your diet aggressively you inevitably run into these.\n\nThe perpetual over-seasoning over everything, perfectly optimised for tastiness by capitalism leads to desensitisation.\n\nVarious of these pathways lead to inflammation and low-grade allergies => many people walk around with perpetually inflamed sinuses, this fucks with taste.\n\nOnce you break out of all of this enough, your base human senses assert themselves and you start to find many of these things intolerable, your body justly rebels (as it would've always, but you subdued it, medicated it into compliance) (IMO a lot of the allergies are likely caused by the body going ""full rebellion"" because it feels so trash it assumes (reasonably) that whatever it's ingesting is attacking it. Unfortunately its usual weapons are more damaging here)\nhttps://t.co/ed06gW8oeD\n\nAllergies are clearly incredibly heavily mediated by mental health, you can control them to an extent but not fully. I'heared of them being healed and partially healed by ""woo healers"". A monocausal explanation here is too reductive.\nhttps://t.co/fkxmSoRDAU\n\nI feel like there's way more to write but I've got to go, I need to write all this down, ideally add graphics. Below I'll comment on your specific case and do the same for my specifics.\n\nOh and have you considered getting a continuous glucose monitor? I'm too broke to get one but I think it can give amazing insight just by correlate blood glucose levels with various events."
